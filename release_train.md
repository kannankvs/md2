# Release Process for Feature Development

SONiC release follows the standard development cycle that includes Planning, Design, Coding, Testing and Release as given below.

## Planning 
This phase includes the following activities.
1. Members/Partners should plan the feature/enhancement for a particular release train and inform the community to add it to the roadmap within a month after previous release. For example, commitment for feature development for 202012 release should happen latest by July2020. 
2. Feature owner should provide the development plan to community with tentative dates for HLD review and Code review.
3. Request the community/partners for reviewer(s) and finalize the reviewer(s).

## Design
This phase includes the following activities. 
1. Feature owner should do the design for the feature by analyzing the various possible design alternatives and prepare the design documet in markdown format.
2. Design document should explain how the feature fits into SONiC architecture and explain the design in detail. It should include command line interfaces planned, configuration database & schema details, required SAI changes, sequence daigram explaining the code flow between various modules(feature module, swss, syncd, various DBs, SAI, Kernel, management modules like CLI, swss/orchagent), containerization, dockers plan, warmboot details, build changes if required, and the unit test cases.
3. Raise Pull Request(PR) in the Azure/SONiC repository in the appropriate folder inside [doc folder](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/tree/master/doc).
4. Inform the community about the PR and schedule the review meeting. 
5. Present the design during the review meeting. If there are multiple open questions at the end of meeting, schedule offline discussion with the reviewers and address them.
6. Address the review comments and ensure that the HLD is merged. 

All of the above design activities should be completed before fourth month of a release. For example the design PR for 202012 release should be merged latest by Oct2020.

``` 
Example Feature : Dynamic Port Breakout - developed for 202006 release

a) Design doucment PR - https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/pull/450 
b) Design review meeting - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sonicproject/jznL7kDtfUM/RiQnZ-BsAwAJ 
c) Design review completion and minutes - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sonicproject/kST4pB3k-Hw/c-cL03PhAwAJ 
d) Merged design document - https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/dynamic-port-breakout/sonic-dynamic-port-breakout-HLD.md

```

## Coding & Testing 
Code phase activities are, 
1. Code the feature and raise a PR for the codes. 
2. All the PR pertaining to the feature should be listed and informed to the community. 
3. Inform the reviewer about the PR and schedule the review. 
4. Address the review comments and ensure that the PR is merged.
5. Testing for the code should go in parallel along with the Test report. 
6. Code PR should be raised latest by 5th month of the release. For example the code PRs for 202012 release, should have been raised latest by Nov2020.
7. Code owner should periodically inform the PR status changes to the SONiC documentation team so that the same can be tracked in [Release Progress Tracking](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/Release-Progress-Tracking-202006) sheet. 
8. All PRâ€™s related to feature should be labelled/Tagged with the feature name. 
9. Code PR review and merging should be completed by last month of the release. For example the PR merge for 202012 release, should be completed by Dec2020. 
10. Configuarion guide and command line interface  related changes pertaining to the feature should be updated in the following documents and PRs should be raised in their repositories. 
    a) [Configuration guide](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/blob/master/doc/Configuration.md)
	b) [CLI document](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-utilities/blob/master/doc/Command-Reference.md) 

``` 
Example Feature : Dynamic Port Breakout - developed for 202006 release

	Code PRs 	:		https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/1242
					https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/pull/3910
					https://github.com/Azure/sonic-utilities/pull/765
					https://github.com/Azure/sonic-platform-common/pull/72
				
```

## Release
1. With completion of all the activities for the feature, a [branch](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/tree/202006) will be pulled out on the last day of the release. For example branch pull for the 202012 release, will happen on 31st Dec 2020.
2. Image stabilization shall happen for 1 or 2 months after branching. 
3. Release notes will be prepared by the SONiC documentation team and will be released to the community.
