There will be periodic SONiC Roadmap planning sessions.  These will define the new capabilities to be delivered by the SONiC project in its next release.  It's expected that new feature contributions will be aligned with the roadmap.  

Pull requests for features that are not in the roadmap may not be accepted into the project.  This is to help ensure the project can produce a stable, reliable release and make progress.
