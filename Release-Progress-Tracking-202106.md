| V4/V6 L3 ACL optimization | March<br>Need ETA | Innovium | BRCM/<br>LinkedIn |Deferred |No| | Currently SONiC uses separate ACL tables for L3 and L3v6 RACLs. In some ASICs, if a user wants both v4 and v6 rules, they would end up using two hardware ACL tables instead of one.<br>The proposal is to give the platform the ability to mention if they want to support L3 and L3V6 ACLs in the same hardware ACL Table. <br>This approach has been taken in the community for Mirror ACL tables but not for L3 ACLs. We are extending this to L3 ACLs as well.|
