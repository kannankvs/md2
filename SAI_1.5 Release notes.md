PRs related to this feature are [PR958](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/958) and [PR959](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/959)

## 1.2 NAT  
Provisioning of APIs to configure NAT feature. API set is generic to configure various types of NAT. A SAI pipeline including NAT is added in this release.  

**Features:** 
1. Basic NAT (SNAT, DNAT)
2. subnet based NAT
3. NAPT
4. Double NAT
5. NAT Exceptions
6. NAT Hairpin

New SAI APIs are introduced for configuring the following.

## 1.3 sFlow  

sFlow (defined in https://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt) is a standard-based sampling technology the meets the key requirements of network traffic monitoring on switches and routers. sFlow uses two types of sampling:

- A statistical packet-based sampling of switched or routed packet flows to provide visibility into network usage and active routes
- A time-based sampling of interface counters.  

The sFlow monitoring system consists of:

- sFlow agents that reside in network equipment which gather network traffic and port counters and combines the flow samples and interface counters into sFlow datagrams and forwards them to the sFlow collector at regular intervals over a UDP socket  
- sFlow collectors which receive and analyze the sFlow data.  

sFlow support in SAI requires both sample packet proposal and host-if proposal changes. The sample packet APIs haven't changed and is used as-is. Host-if is updated to create a new Generic Netlink based interface to lift sFlow samples to the application (sFlow agents) using the following new attributes:  
* SAI_HOSTIF_TYPE_GENETLINK  
* SAI_HOSTIF_ATTR_GENETLINK_MCGRP_NAME  
* SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_CHANNEL_TYPE_GENETLINK  

PRs related to Host-if proposal changes are [936](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/936) and [997](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/997)

## 1.4 Generic Resource Monitoring
SAI manages ASIC resources. It is important for the user to query the current resources usage in the ASIC for different types of SAI objects. It is also essential to make as much resources availability exposed as possible. 

### 1.4.1 Generic Resource Monitoring API

1) **sai_object_type_get_availability**: This is a generic API for SAI resource monitoring. The function accepts an object type for which availability is queried. A new annotation is added to mark object attributes that are used to distinguish between different resource pools of the same object type.  
 ```
   sai_status_t sai_object_type_get_availability(
        _In_ sai_object_type_t object_type,
        _In_ uint32_t attr_count,
        _In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr_list,
        _Out_ uint64_t *count);
 ```
PRs related to Resource monitoring function addition is [942](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/942)

## 1.5 SAI counter
Defining counters explicitly per object type imposes restrictions to their usage. Hence the new counter's model introduces APIs to query which objects support which counters and create a counter object that can be dynamically attached to other objects  

### 1.5.1 New SAI counter APIs

1) **sai_create_counter**: This API creates a counter that can be attached to an object to collect the statistics. Attaching a counter to an object does not clear it's stats values.
```
   sai_status_t (*sai_create_counter_fn)(
   	_Out_ sai_object_id_t *counter_id, 
	_In_ sai_object_id_t switch_id, 
	_In_ uint32_t attr_count, 
	_In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr_list);  
```
2) **sai_remove_counter**: This API removes a counter that is attached to an object to collect the statistics. Detaching a counter from an object does not clear it's stats values
```
   sai_status_t (*sai_remove_counter_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id);
```
3) **sai_set_counter_attribute**: This API sets the attribute value for the given object ID
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_set_counter_attribute_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
   	_In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr);
   ```
4) **sai_get_counter_attribute**: This API gets the counter's attribute values for the given object ID 
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_get_counter_attribute_fn)(
		_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
		_In_ uint32_t attr_count, 
		_Inout_ sai_attribute_t *attr_list);
   ```

5) **sai_get_counter_stats**: This API gets the counter statistics values
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_get_counter_stats_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
   	_In_ uint32_t number_of_counters, 
   	_In_ const sai_stat_id_t *counter_ids, 
   	_Out_ uint64_t *counters);  

6) **sai_get_counter_stats_ext**: This API gets the statistics of the IP packets collected from the counters
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_get_counter_stats_ext_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
   	_In_ uint32_t number_of_counters, 
   	_In_ const sai_stat_id_t *counter_ids, 
   	_In_ sai_stats_mode_t mode, 
   	_Out_ uint64_t *counters);  
   ```
7) **sai_clear_counter_stats**: This API clears the statistics collected in the counters  
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_clear_counter_stats_fn)(
		_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
		_In_ uint32_t number_of_counters, 
		_In_ const sai_stat_id_t *counter_ids);  
   ```
PRs related to Resource monitoring function addition is [939](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/939)

**NOTE**: The APIs that define certain attributes are Adapter-specific extensions to SAI, most typically to expose differentiated functionality in the underlying forwarding element. These are added to minimize compatibility issues with versioning of structures and to allow API extensibility  

## 1.6 Drop Counters  
  A new list of drop counters is added in the structure "sai_port_in_drop_reason_t", that includes dropping reasons like source mac being multicast, source mac same as destination mac etc. as given in the design document.
  
A new set of SAI API's is added as follows to support this feature. 

### 1.6.1 New Drop counter APIs

1. **sai_create_debug_counter_fn**: This API is used to create debug counter

   ```
	sai_status_t (*sai_create_debug_counter_fn)(
	    	_Out_ sai_object_id_t *debug_counter_id,  
	    	_In_ sai_object_id_t switch_id,  
	    	_In_ uint32_t attr_count,  
	    	_In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr_list);  
	 ```
2. **sai_remove_debug_counter_fn**: This API is used to remove debug counter

     ```

     ```
3. **sai_set_debug_counter_attribute_fn**: This API is used to set debug counter attribute Value

  	```
	sai_status_t (*sai_set_debug_counter_attribute_fn)(
		_In_ sai_object_id_t debug_counter_id,  
		_In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr);  
  	```		
4. **sai_get_debug_counter_attribute_fn**: This API is used to get debug counter attribute Value
	 ``` 
	sai_status_t (*sai_get_debug_counter_attribute_fn)(
        	_In_ sai_object_id_t debug_counter_id,
