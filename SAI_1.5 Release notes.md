# 2. Features And Enhancements  

## 2.1 TAM  

Telemetry And Monitoring (TAM) has been enhanced from 1.0 to 2.0 to achieve the following goals:
1. Express top-level Telemetry and Monitoring domain for Inband Telemetry
2. Remain backwards compatible for application with minimal or no change in the application code
3. Provide extensibility for new functions/capability in each domain/subdomain and always remain backward compatible
4. Remove any hard coded assumptions about domain or domainâ€™s capabilities
5. Provide full abstraction for operators to dynamically learn the number of domains supported within a networking element
6. Provide full abstraction for operators to dynamically learn domains capabilities
7. Provide flexibility to add new APIs for a given domain/subdomain
8. Support local mathematical functions for hierarchical analysis

## 2.2 NAT  
Provisioning of APIs to configure NAT feature. API set is generic to configure various types of NAT.  

**Features:** 
1. Basic NAT (SNAT, DNAT)
2. subnet based NAT
3. NAPT
4. Double NAT
5. NAT Exceptions
6. NAT Hairpin

New SAI APIs are introduced for configuring the following.

2) **Enabling NAT**: This defines the SAI NAT specifications with attributes such as 'range', set', 'get', 'remove' etc  
3) **Enable Traps for SNAT, DNAT and HAIRPIN Miss Packets**: Traps are configured to record the count of packets based on the source and destination Network Address Translation.
4) **TAM GET API**: Besides configuration, this API can read the NAT table to get aging details.

## 2.3 sFlow  

sFlow (defined in https://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt) is a standard-based sampling technology the meets the key requirements of network traffic monitoring on switches and routers. sFlow uses two types of sampling:

- A statistical packet-based sampling of switched or routed packet flows to provide visibility into network usage and active routes
- A time-based sampling of interface counters.  

The sFlow monitoring system consists of:

- sFlow agents that reside in network equipment which gather network traffic and port counters and combines the flow samples and interface counters into sFlow datagrams and forwards them to the sFlow collector at regular intervals over a UDP socket  
- sFlow collectors which receive and analyze the sFlow data.  

sFlow support in SAI requires both sample packet proposal and host-if proposal changes. The sample packet APIs haven't changed and is used as-is. Host-if is updated to create a new Generic Netlink based interface to lift sFlow samples to the application (sFlow agents) using the following new attributes:  
* SAI_HOSTIF_TYPE_GENETLINK  
* SAI_HOSTIF_ATTR_GENETLINK_MCGRP_NAME  
* SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_CHANNEL_TYPE_GENETLINK  

PRs related to Host-if proposal changes are [936](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/936) and [997](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/997)

## 2.4 Generic Resource Monitoring
SAI manages ASIC resources. It is important for the user to query the current resources usage in the ASIC for different types of SAI objects. It is also essential to make as much resources availability exposed as possible. 

### 2.4.1 Generic Resource Monitoring API

1) **sai_object_type_get_availability**: This is a generic API for SAI resource monitoring. The function accepts an object type for which availability is queried. A new annotation is added to mark object attributes that are used to distinguish between different resource pools of the same object type.  
 ```
   sai_status_t sai_object_type_get_availability(
        _In_ sai_object_type_t object_type,
        _In_ uint32_t attr_count,
        _In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr_list,
        _Out_ uint64_t *count);
  ```
PRs related to Resource monitoring function addition is [942](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/942)

## 2.5 SAI counter
Defining counters explicitly per object type imposes restrictions to their usage. Hence the new counter's model introduces APIs to query which objects support which counters and create a counter object that can be dynamically attached to other objects  

### 2.5.1 New SAI counter APIs

1) **sai_create_counter**: This API creates a counter that can be attached to an object to collect the statistics. Attaching a counter to an object does not clear it's stats values.
```
   sai_status_t (*sai_create_counter_fn)(
   	_Out_ sai_object_id_t *counter_id, 
	_In_ sai_object_id_t switch_id, 
	_In_ uint32_t attr_count, 
	_In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr_list);  
 ```
2) **sai_remove_counter**: This API removes a counter that is attached to an object to collect the statistics. Detaching a counter from an object does not clear it's stats values
```
   sai_status_t (*sai_remove_counter_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id);
   ```
3) **sai_set_counter_attribute**: This API sets the attribute value for the given object ID
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_set_counter_attribute_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
   	_In_ const sai_attribute_t *attr);
   ```
4) **sai_get_counter_attribute**: This API gets the counter's attribute values for the given object ID 
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_get_counter_attribute_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
	_In_ uint32_t attr_count, 
	_Inout_ sai_attribute_t *attr_list);
   ```

5) **sai_get_counter_stats**: This API gets the counter statistics values
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_get_counter_stats_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
   	_In_ uint32_t number_of_counters, 
   	_In_ const sai_stat_id_t *counter_ids, 
   	_Out_ uint64_t *counters);  

6) **sai_get_counter_stats_ext**: This API gets the statistics of the IP packets collected from the counters
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_get_counter_stats_ext_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
   	_In_ uint32_t number_of_counters, 
   	_In_ const sai_stat_id_t *counter_ids, 
   	_In_ sai_stats_mode_t mode, 
   	_Out_ uint64_t *counters);  
   ```
7) **sai_clear_counter_stats**: This API clears the statistics collected in the counters  
   ```
   sai_status_t (*sai_clear_counter_stats_fn)(
   	_In_ sai_object_id_t counter_id, 
	_In_ uint32_t number_of_counters, 
	_In_ const sai_stat_id_t *counter_ids);  
   ```
PRs related to Resource monitoring function addition is [939](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/939)

**NOTE**: The APIs that define certain attributes are Adapter-specific extensions to SAI, most typically to expose differentiated functionality in the underlying forwarding element. These are added to minimize compatibility issues with versioning of structures and to allow API extensibility  

## 2.6 Drop Counters  
  ASICs can provide a set of debug counters for certain object types. Debug counters belong to certain families, each family is for certain object type. The content of a specific debug counter instance can be defined by the application. Counting every statistics of every family might be too resource intensive, therefore the debug counters provide an efficient way to count and aggregate only the needed information.

Example :
 ```
enum _sai_debug_counter_type_t {
    /** Port in drop reasons. Base object : SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_PORT */
    SAI_DEBUG_COUNTER_TYPE_PORT_IN_DROP_REASONS,
     /** Port out drop reasons. Base object : SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_PORT */
    SAI_DEBUG_COUNTER_TYPE_PORT_OUT_DROP_REASONS,
 } sai_debug_counter_type_t;
 ```
Debug counter port in drop reason family can be expressed as shown below. 
```
 enum _sai_port_in_drop_reason_t {
    /* L2 reasons */
    /* L3 reasons */
 } 
 ```

## 3. Pull Request Details

## SAI Pull Requests

1) [PR929](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/929): saibridge.h: Added bridge port type router to facilitate flooding to the router or a tunnel, on top of the regular behaviour  of flooding to all local ports, without needing to manage the list of local ports, by choosing the combined flood type. A sample use case for flooding to the router, is VXLAN L3 peering use case, demonstrated in OCP, where unknown unicast traffic is sent to the router.  
2) [PR936](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/936): saihostif.h: Added a generic Netlink interface (over a loopback) to receive trapped packets/buffers from the SAI driver. This can be used as an alternative to callback/FD based mechanisms.    
3) [PR937](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/pull/937): sainat.h:  Added Network Address Translation (NAT) specific API definitions.
